## **Project Proposal: Life Tracking Wearable Device**

### **Project Title:**

**Smart Life Tracker for Health, Safety, and Real-Time Location**

---

### **Objective:**

To design and develop a wearable device that monitors heart rate, detects human presence, tracks GPS location, and sends data via GSM or Bluetooth in real-time. It will be useful for civilians, elderly, children, outdoor workers, and armed forces.
